With tabular data, we might anticipate that the patterns we seek could involve interactions among the features, but we do not assume any structure a priori concerning how the features interact.\n",

    "## Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases our ultimate task asks some global question about the image, e.g., does it contain a cat? Consequently, the units of our final layer should be sensitive to the entire input. By gradually aggregating information, yielding coarser and coarser maps, we accomplish this goal of ultimately learning a global representation, while keeping all of the advantages of convolutional layers at the intermediate layers of processing. The deeper we go in the network, the larger the receptive field (relative to the input) to which each hidden node is sensitive. Reducing spatial resolution accelerates this process, since the convolution kernels cover a larger effective area.\n",

    "\n",
    "Like convolutional layers, pooling operators consist of a fixed-shape window that is slid over all regions in the input according to its stride, computing a single output for each location traversed by the fixed-shape window (sometimes known as the pooling window). However, unlike the cross-correlation computation of the inputs and kernels in the convolutional layer, the pooling layer contains no parameters (there is no kernel). Instead, pooling operators are deterministic, typically calculating either the maximum or the average value of the elements in the pooling window. These operations are called maximum pooling (max-pooling for short) and average pooling, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the pooling window as starting from the upper-left of the input tensor and sliding across it from left to right and top to bottom. At each location that the pooling window hits, it computes the maximum or average value of the input subtensor in the window, depending on whether max or average pooling is employed.\n",
